#Promptopia

Promptopia is a project built with Next.js and MongoDB. The project also used:

1. Google user authentication for user account creation
2. Create user profiles
3. User is able to create, edit and delete posts
4. Creating of #tags that are searchable
5. Created searchable text the returns the selected Prompt card
6. Used tracking software to document bugs and solutions.

This was a beneficial project to do. This was the first time I used Next.js and MongoDB. Even though I followed the project tutorial, I still had considerable troubleshooting to do.
I had problems with Google authentication. It looks like Google changed the authorization process between the time the project tutorial was published and when I was doing it. I also had to troubleshoot Auth new issues in production versus development.
I learned the basics of MongoDB. This was a good introduction to databases.
Finally, during my build testing, there were some functional issues I found with buttons that didn't work correctly, #tags that didn't save, search results that didn't diplay as expected and page didn't reload after deletion.
