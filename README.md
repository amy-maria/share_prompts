#Promptopia

Promptopia is a project built with Next.js and MongoDB. The project also used:

1. Google user authentication for user account creation
2. Create user profiles
3. User is able to create, edit and delete posts
4. Creating of #tags that are searchable

This was a beneficial project to do. This was the first time I used Next.js and MongoDB. Even though I followed the project tutorial, I still had considerable troubleshooting to do. I had problems with Google authentication. It looks like Google changed the authorization process between the time the project tutorial was published and when I was doing it.
I also had to learn the basics of MongoDB. This was a good introduction to databases.
Finally, during my build testing, there were some functional issues I found with buttons that didn't work correctly and #tags that didn't save.
